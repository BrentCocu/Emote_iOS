# Emote


An app used for patients with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) to help them keep track of their emotional states and can be used as a tool for DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy). This form of therapy is the current standard for treating BPD. It focusses on learning the patient to better identify his or her emotional states. The ideal use-case for Emote would be as a diary-keeping tool to support actual therapy. The user first registers a number of possible emotions and links them to a color. It is then possible to quickly log emotionial states during the day.
