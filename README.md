# Emote
An app used for patients with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) to help them keep track of their emotional states and can be used as a tool for DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy). This form of therapy is the current standard for treating BPD. It focusses on learning the patient to better identify his or her emotional states. The ideal use-case for Emote would be as a diary-keeping tool to support actual therapy. The user first registers a number of possible emotions and links them to a color. It is then possible to quickly log emotionial states during the day.

## Getting Started
Download the zip file on the master branch or clone the project through git. Make sure you have CocoaPods properly installed on your machine. Open Terminal and `cd` to the root directory of the project. Run the command `pod install` and wait for it to complete. Once all dependencies are installed, you can open the project in XCode, build and run it. The app will automatically be installed to your linked iOS-device or emulator.

## Prerequisites
- XCode 9.4 (or higher)
- iOS 11 (or higher)
- iOS-device or emulator
